<p>The North Carolina Baroque Orchestra (NCBO), a period instrument ensemble, was co-founded in 2011 by sisters and musical collaborators Frances Blaker and Barbara Blaker Krumdieck for the purpose of providing orchestral and chamber music opportunities for musicians specializing in baroque performance practice.</p>

<p>It was clear from their first concerts in 2011 that there was a need for NCBO. The musicians were hungry for an opportunity to play baroque orchestral music on period instruments at a professional level, and the audiences were excited by their exuberant, refreshing and inspiring performances.</p>

<p>The North Carolina Baroque Orchestra maintains a goal of presenting refined, stylistic, artistic and fun performances, engaging both the players and the listeners in the stories and historical context behind the music.</p>

<p>Conductor and artistic director Frances Blaker is a virtuoso recorder player and world-renowned expert in baroque performance practice, teaching workshops throughout The United States and Europe. She is a unique and exciting conductor, inspiring the NCBO players to bring new life to old music! Ms Blaker lives in the San Francisco Bay Area where she maintains an active teaching studio and works on her compositions.</p>

<p>Cellist and executive director Barbara Krumdieck manages all of the details involved in putting performances together. The NCBO players travel in from near and far. Some are in the Carolinas, but a large number of the players travel in from all over the country including California, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee , Georgia, Washington, D.C., Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia. Ms. Krumdieck contracts the musicians, arranges for their transportation and housing, provides them with music and makes them feel welcome and valued within NCBO. She is also liaison between the orchestra and choir directors who contract NCBO for their special projects.</p>
